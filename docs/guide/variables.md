## Adding variables

Each variable is specified by a 9 group code giving the variable's name, followed by groups that supply the variable's value:

```txt
  9
$NAME // The name of the variable.
  10  // First group code
20    // The value assocoated
  20  // Second group code
20    // The value assocoated
// And so on...

// These values are random.
```

Javascript code :

```js
import DxfWriter from "@tarikjabiri/dxf";

const dxf = new DxfWriter();

dxf.setVariable("$ATTMODE", { 70: 2 });

// $ATTMODE is the name of the variable
// 70 is the group code
// 2 is the value to be set.
dxf.setVariable("$PLIMMAX", {
  10: 20,
  20: 30,
}); // This variable accept tow group codes and tow values
```
